  <h1>Chicken Parmesan</h1>
  <p>
    My version of chicken Parmesan is a little different than what
    they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.

  <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
    <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes </li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
  <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
  <p>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Place chicken breasts between two sheets 
    of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) 
    on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the 
    smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. 
    Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts,
     evenly coating both sides 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 5</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 6</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. 
    Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, 
    pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. 
    Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 7</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until 
    it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, 
    about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 8</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons 
    tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella 
    cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan 
    over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. 
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Step 9</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and 
    chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. 
    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at 
    least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
