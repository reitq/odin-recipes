    <h1><strong>Beef Ragu</strong></h1>
    <p>
      Beef ragu—a traditional Italian dish—is a slow-simmered sauce made with beef, 
      tomatoes, pasta, etc. Many newer ragu recipes use sambal oelek or anchovy paste 
      to help build flavor, so I've used harissa, but feel free to replace with 1/2 teaspoon 
      crushed red pepper or 1 teaspoon fennel seeds or omit. If you like you can add rosemary 
      sprigs to the sauce as it simmers.

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. 
      Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. 
      Sear meat until browned on every side, working in batches if necessary, 
      about 10 minutes. Remove from Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate. 
    </p>

    <h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, stirring often, until softened, 
      about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 
      about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, 
      until caramelized, about 2 minutes. 
    </p>

    <h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen 
      any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, 
      bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. 
      Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors 
      meld, about 2 1/2 hours. 
    </p>

    <h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting board 
      and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in pappardelle. 
      Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
